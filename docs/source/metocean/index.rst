MetOcean API
*************

The MetOcean Application Programming Interface provides the mechanism to interact with the persistnat translation informaiton in a coherent manner.

The queries enable logical subsets of the translation store to be retrieved and used by other applications.  The editor uses this interface and it is expected that downstream client applicatinos will extract translation information this way.
